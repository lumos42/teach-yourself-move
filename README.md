## Recommended sequence

- Items marked `read` are to be completed before the beginning of the next item, but may be begun before the prior item.
  - It may be easier to break up reading and start early, interspersing with tutorials.
- When a tutorial is marked `do`, re-write all code.
  - Do not download sample code.
  - Do not copy-paste.
  - If necessary, running from within a provided repo is necessary as long as it is solely in the interest of duplicating behavior to be expected from the already re-written repo.
- When an item is marked `explore`, consider the following:
  - Re-implement examples but with modifications.
  - Create your own new examples using the provided library/framework.
  - Read whatever seems interesting!
